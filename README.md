# Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Company

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company to identify key factors associated with customer cancellations. The analysis focuses on understanding how contract types, promotional offers, service add-ons, and customer behavior relate to churn and revenue loss.

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecommunications companies, as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The company aims to reduce churn by identifying high-risk customer segments, understanding the main drivers of churn, and evaluating the financial impact of customer cancellations.

## Dataset Description
- The dataset contains 7,044 customer records, where each row represents a single customer.
- The data covers customer activity during a single fiscal quarter.
- Features include:
  - Customer demographics
  - Contract and billing information
  - Service usage details
  - Revenue-related metrics
  - Customer churn status and churn reasons
 
## Analysis Steps
1. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand customer distribution and churn rate.
2. Analyzed churn metrics across contract types, promotional offers, and service add-ons.
3. Created visualizations to study the relationship between tenure and churn behavior.
4. Analyzed churn reasons and quantified revenue loss across different contract durations.
5. Summarized insights to support data-driven retention strategies.

## Key Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts show the highest churn volume.
- Customers without promotional offers have higher churn rates compared to those with offers.
- Customers without online security are significantly more likely to churn.
- The most common churn reasons are related to competitors offering better deals and devices.
